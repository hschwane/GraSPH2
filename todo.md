# my todo list

## high priority

### particle management

- better defaults for particle load and store
- check for valid parameters on all template calls
- save make functions for all buffers (like the one the particle has)
- more safety / better errors when dealing with particle buffers

- think about the particle management carefully
- think about particles during init carefully

- use the new particle things in a correct way

### simulation management
- find better solution for the stuff in the algorithms file


## medium priority

### particle creation
- add 2d image source from the other branch
- make modifiers work
- add modifieres
- add sources
- add constructors for uniform sphere

### usability
- more runtime options vs compiletime options

### simulation management
- make the compute derivitives function more organized
- find better solution for 2D simulation

### integration
- automatically integrate what is needed using TMP

### performance
- somehow automatically adjust particle attributes based on options
- optimize the functions in models.h

### simulation features
- add functionality from the other branch

### output data handling
- use pinned host memory here
- remove the stream sync points
- cuda memcopy is not async


## low priority / ideas / long term projects

### particle creation
- add python script support to generate initials

### particle management
- enhance compile time when using particle templates

### simulation management
- find better solution to switch options on and off

### integration
- better structure to different integrators
- adaptive algorithms

### performance
- add datastructures
- try new graph style kernel launching
- MPI support
- share load between CPU and GPU

### simulation features
- linear consistency fix
- investigate angular momentum (not)conservation
- add collisional merging simulation
- different materials (using recursive kernel launches)

### output data handling
- provide binary data format
- provide python script to generate 3d html plots



# finished
for motivation, all finished todo entries are moved here instead of being deleted

- fix initialisation function of particle buffer
- mapped and pinned state of resources is not overwritten after most assignments
- device particles can now be accessed from host code
