# my todo list

## high priority

- use the new particle things in a correct way


## medium priority

### particle creation
- think about particles during init carefully
- add 2d image source from the other branch
- make modifiers work
- add modifieres
- add sources
- add constructors for uniform sphere

### usability
- more runtime options vs compiletime options

### simulation management
- make the compute derivitives function more organized
- find better solution for 2D simulation
- fix xsph

### integration
- automatically integrate what is needed using TMP

### performance
- somehow automatically adjust particle attributes based on options
- optimize the functions in models.h

### simulation features
- add functionality from the other branch

### output data handling
- use pinned host memory here
- remove the stream sync points
- cuda memcopy is not async


## low priority / ideas / long term projects

### particle creation
- add python script support to generate initials

### particle management
- enhance compile time when using particle templates
- have attributes that are the same for all particles in constant memory
- better storage for long data types like matrices

### simulation management
- find better solution to switch options on and off

### integration
- better structure to different integrators
- adaptive algorithms

### performance
- check out shuffle operations an vote functions
- add datastructures
- try new graph style kernel launching
- MPI support
- share load between CPU and GPU
- better memory alignment for matrices

### simulation features
- linear consistency fix
- investigate angular momentum (not)conservation
- add collisional merging simulation
- different materials (using recursive kernel launches)

### output data handling
- provide binary data format
- provide python script to generate 3d html plots



# finished
for motivation, all finished todo entries are moved here instead of being deleted

- algorithms now use templates instead of macros
- fix initialisation function of particle buffer
- add function to concatenate and merge particles
- big overhaul of the particle storage system including:
    - easier to use correctly
    - better error messages if used incorrectly
    - load_particle without arguments now returns a particle with all attributes stored in the buffer, instead of an empty particle
    - host buffer, device buffer and device reference (previously device copy) have separate classes
    - device buffer can now load and store particles from host code
    - different particle buffers can be created from each other
    - pinned host memory can be used for host particle buffer
    - derivatives are now marked as such in the particle buffer
    - mapped and pinned state of resources is not overwritten after most assignments
